This script merge the files given by means of bytes operation, files 
processing functions, and string processing. On top of that, it also 
provide the specification of the input and check if they share the same 
width and height, ensuring that the output being complete as we expected.
## reflection: 
As a matter of fact, I've already learned several programming language and 
attended APCS few times in the past three years. To me, it's not really 
difficult to finish the weekly homework and memorize these basic syntax. 
However, it was not untill the mid-term that remind me how small I am. 
After that, I started to focus on the lecture and leetcode if available, 
hope to get a decent great on final exam. Additionally, working on these 
projects really remind me of the days when i was making a shitty 
porn-crawling script in the high school. At the moment, I always thinking 
myself a advanced programmer. In fact, those code is simply the asymptote 
of low-efficiency and engery-wasting. Using high-level language doesn't 
make me an advanced programmer, but optimizing efficiency does. In sum, i 
am satisfied with professor Wang's lecture and surly will I select this 
course next term.
